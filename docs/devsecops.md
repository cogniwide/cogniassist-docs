### Secure Coding using DevSecOps Framework

CogniAssist follows DevSecOps practises to enable enhanced automation throughout the software delivery pipeline to eliminate coding mistakes and ultimately reduce security breaches. The various techniques and key components of DevSecOps practises adopted in CogniAssist product development are mentioned below.

* Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scans the application source files, accurately identifies the root cause and helps remediate the underlying security flaws.

* Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) simulates controlled attacks on a running web application or service to identify exploitable vulnerabilities in a running environment.

* Software Composition Analysis (SCA) automates the visibility into open source software (OSS) for the purpose of risk management, security and license compliance. 

During CogniAssist product development, DevSecOps tools and processes help to integrate security into the DevOps framework to release secure and vulnerable free software. Developers test code for security and detect security flaws as code is written and at various stages of development to ensure secure code is released to production.
