Small talks make your bot conversation natural with the customer. It includes greetings, acknowledgements and off-topic chats, which gives the feel of an actual conversation.

***Note*** - As soon as you create a project, a set of pre-defined small talks are available, which has its default response.

***Note*** - 

- You can add multi-line responses.
- You can preferably add 5 responses for an intent. It is possible to add over 5 responses as well.

#### **Default Small talk**

You can add intents and edit the responses in the **Default** section. Check the below sample intents of default small talks.

1. Default Welcome - This is the bot's first response to the user to maintain customer engagement. Example, as soon as the user comes online, the bot starts the conversation with the pre-defined welcome message "Hi, I am your digital support bot, I am here to help you with any questions you have".

   ***Note*** - You are not allowed to delete the small talks in the **Default** section.

2. Fallback - If the bot cannot find an appropriate response to the user's query, the bot provides a fallback response. Example, if the user asks "What is the latest news today?", the bot replies "Please ask a different question" as the intent is inappropriate to the bot.
