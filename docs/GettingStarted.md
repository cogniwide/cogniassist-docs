***Note*** - The existing project displays the current status, deployed date and time and the instance details of the bot.

| Project status                                               | Description                                                  |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img src="assets/CA_004.png?lastModify=1589564525" alt="img" style="zoom:50%;" /> | Bot is online                                                |
| <img src="assets/CA_005.png?lastModify=1589564525" alt="img" style="zoom:50%;" /> | Project is stopped                                           |
| <img src="assets/CA_006.png?lastModify=1589564525" alt="img" style="zoom:50%;" /> | As soon as the project is created, the status will be **Not Available**. |

You can edit or delete the existing project using the settings icon <img src="assets/CA_003.png" style="zoom: 33%;" /> based on the access provided to you. Example, only an **Admin** user can delete the existing project. Click here, to find out how to edit an existing bot configuration.
