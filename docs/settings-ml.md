If the bot is unable to answer the user's query, it offers a  fallback response. To classify the user query confidently, you need to set the threshold limit for intents and small talks. 

Click the **Machine Learning** option from the left side menu of the screen. It displays the following screen.

***Note*** - If the threshold is very high, then the AI bot will respond only if the confidence level is high.
