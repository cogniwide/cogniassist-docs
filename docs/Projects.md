Once you sign into the CogniAssist platform, it directs you to a project dashboard in which you can create a new bot or look into the existing bot configurations. ![](assets\CA_001.png)

***Note*** - The existing project displays the current status, deployed date and time and the instance details of the bot.

| Project status         | Description                                                  |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](assets\CA_004.png) | Bot is online                                                |
| ![](assets\CA_005.png) | Project is stopped                                           |
| ![](assets\CA_006.png) | As soon as you create a project, the status will be **Not Available**. |

You can edit or delete the existing project using the settings icon ![](assets\CA_003.png) based on the access provided to you. Example, only an **Admin** user can delete the existing project.

***Note*** - 

- The project **Admins** have full access and control over each aspect of the project.
- The **User** has the access to edit the project but not allowed to launch it.
- The **Spectator** can only view or chat with the bot.

Once you create a project, click the project name, it directs you to a bot building platform.
