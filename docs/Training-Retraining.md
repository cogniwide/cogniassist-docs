## Re-Training

You can evaluate and re-train the bot for the failed scenarios which improve your AI bot's response to the user's query 

You can manually tune the AI bot by monitoring the AI bot interaction logs. You can skip or ignore the irrelevant queries which are logged as failed scenarios in this section. 

Select **Re-Training**  under the **Training** module, it directs you to the **Re-Training** screen.

Once you map a failed query with the relevant intent, click **Validate**. This will train the bot on the failed query. If you find that the query is irrelevant to your domain, you can click **Skip** to ignore the failed query.
