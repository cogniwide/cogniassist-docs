You can evaluate and re-train the bot for the failed scenarios which improve your AI bot's response to the user's query. You can manually tune the AI bot through monitoring the AI bot interaction logs. 

Select **Re-Training**  under the **Training** module, it directs you to the **Re-Training** screen. All the falied queries are listed in this screen. You can skip or ignore the irrelevant queries which are logged as failed scenarios in this section.

Once you map a failed query with the relevant intent, click **Validate**. This will train the bot on the failed query. If you find that the query is irrelevant to your domain, you can click **Skip** to ignore the failed query.
